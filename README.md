# Multi-Armed-Bandits-Project

## Determining the best combination
This project is based on a case study of Obama’s fundraising campaign. The campaign team experimented with two parts of the splash page of their fundraising website: the “Media” section at the top and the callto-action “Button”. There are a total of 24 different combinations that they could have used. They wished to figure out which combination gives the highest sign up rate (the greatest number of clicks). In this project, I tried to figure out which of the 24 arms is the best, in the least amount of tries as possible.
